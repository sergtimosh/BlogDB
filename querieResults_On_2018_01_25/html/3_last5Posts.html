Hey @vlad_mihalcea is there a way in which persistence.xml file can be replaced with Java config class? Any documentation related to this would be really helpful.

Previously, I wrote an article about bootstrapping Hibernate without the persistence.xml, but that solution was based on the Hibernate-specific EntityManagerFactoryBuilderImpl.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>BIG CHANGES TO THE BIKE198 WEBSITES</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>First, thank you for the continued support of Bike198 and the content we publish here. We greatly appreciate it and your spreading of our content on the web allows us to continue with the site. Without you guys…Bike198 is nothing but words on a screen.

To make things more organized…there have been some big changes made to the Bike198 family of websites over the weekend. Now…mountain, road and commuter sites are all on Bike198.com instead of having their own separate subdomains. This does several things for you guys…

Makes things easier to find and search across all disciplines.
Creates a combined feed for those that want to keep track of everything going on at Bike198.
It also makes our life much easier by bringing everything to a single site with a single login to update everything we have going on in the cycling world.

If you are already signed up for one of the newsletters or RSS feeds, nothing changes for you there. You are still subscribed the same way you were before (mountain, road or urban). If you would like to sign up for the combined RSS feed or one of the other feeds, the links are below.

THE BIKE198 FORUMS
You will also notice that we started to style the Bike198 forums to match the rest of the site. This will continue to be integrated more for a seamless experience between the two.

The forums have gotten off to a great start…but we need your help. We want to have a growing community centered around Bike198 and the dedication to all things biking, so we need you to register for the forums…if you haven’t already…and tell your riding friends about it as well on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, local forums or where ever else you hangout online.

Thank you for the continued support! Tell your friends about the new forum…let’s get this thing really rolling!
